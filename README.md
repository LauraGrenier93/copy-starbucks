# copy-starbucks

## Description

This is a copy of the Starbucks Rewards page features.

It allowed me to practice on:

- making a dynamic menu
- positioning in display flex
- the superposition of elements
- the realization of discrete animations thanks to CSS.

## Stack

- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS made mobile first
